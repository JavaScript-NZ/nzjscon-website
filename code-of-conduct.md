__nz.js(con);__ is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
or expelled from the conference *without a refund* at the discretion of the
conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the
right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all
participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
conference *with no refund*.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the
clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any
participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules
outside event activities too!

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible.  Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People
like you make our event a better place.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

### Anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous report [via this form](https://goo.gl/forms/QJs8xqck4GMMZb8C2).

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully
investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

### Personal Report

You can make a personal report by:

* Calling or messaging this phone number: [022 477 3778](tel:+64224773778). This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of the event.
* Contacting a conference volunteer, identified by yellow lanyard.
* Email us at [conference@javascript.org.nz](mailto:conference@javascript.org.nz).

When taking a personal report, our volunteers will ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. They may involve other event volunteers or the conference
organisers to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you
to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as
respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be
asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact local law enforcement, local support
services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration
of the event. We value your attendance.
