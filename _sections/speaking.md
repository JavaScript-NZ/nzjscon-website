## Become a speaker

We think New Zealand's JavaScript community is diverse, forwards thinking, and varied; we want to to give you a chance to share your perspectives and experience with your fellow developers and the next generation of students.

Our call for papers is __now live__. That means that you (yes you) can apply to become a speaker at __nz.js(con);__.

<a href='https://www.papercall.io/nz-js-con' class='btn btn-primary'>Make a talk submission</a>

The conference will have two tracks, which means we've got plenty of schedule slots available. We are keen to support both experienced and new speakers. If you've never spoken at a conference before we'll be offering some support to make sure you have a good experience.

Need some help writing your proposal? Check out the resources at [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html) or drop into the [#js-conf](https://javascriptnewzealand.slack.com/messages/js-conf/) channel on [our Slack](http://slack.javascript.org.nz/) to get a second opinion or three!

All talk slots will be 30 minutes long (25 mins of talk plus 5 minutes of questions). We welcome both intro-level and very technical talks. JavaScript has all kinds of uses, and we'd like the schedule to reflect that. Topics will include (but are not limited to):

* Web development frameworks
* Data visualisation
* Node.js and other server-side technologies
* ES6 & ES7
* Build tooling & pipelines
* Cutting edge new web features
* Mobile development
* Testing
* Security
* Performance
* Nodebots
* Gaming
* Teaching JavaScript
* Programming culture
* Something else we failed to capture here - you tell us!

Please note that __nz.js(con);__ aims to be an inclusive and welcoming event. One step towards that goal is our [Code of Conduct]({{ full_base_url }}/code-of-conduct/) - all talk content will be required to adhere to that.
