## Become a speaker

We think New Zealand's JavaScript community is diverse, forwards thinking, and varied; we want to to give you a chance to share your perspectives and experience with your fellow developers and the next generation of students.

We will soon (late October - sign up to our announcements mailing list below to be notified) be going live with our open CFP (call-for-papers). That means that you (yes you) can apply to become a speaker at __nz.js(con);__

<!--break-->
The conference will have two tracks, which means we've got plenty of schedule slots available. We are keen to support both experienced and new speakers. If you've never spoken at a conference before we'll be offering some support to ensure your talk goes smoothly.

All talk slots will be 30 minutes long (25 mins of talk plus 5 minutes of questions). We welcome both intro-level and very technical talks. JavaScript has all kinds of uses, and we'd like the schedule to reflect that. Topics will include (but are not limited to):

* Web development frameworks
* Data visualisation
* Node.js and other server-side technologies
* ES6 & ES7
* Build tooling & pipelines
* Cutting edge new web features
* Mobile development
* Security
* Performance
* Nodebots
* Gaming
* Teaching JavaScript
* General programming related topics

Please note that __nz.js(con);__ aims to be an inclusive and welcoming event. One step towards that goal is our [Code of Conduct]({{ full_base_url }}/code-of-conduct/) - all talk content will be expected to respect that.
