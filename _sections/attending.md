### Venue

Our venue is Shed 6, which is on the waterfront in Wellington. We'll be splitting the venue up into rooms for the two tracks, and we'll have capacity for around 300 attendees.

<!--break-->
It's next door to the TSB Bank Arena, and only a ten minute walk from Wellington Railway Station (which is also the main bus hub). If you're coming from the airport there is a bus line that takes about half an hour, or a twenty minute taxi journey (depending on traffic).

### Accommodation in Wellington

The waterfront, train station and Lambdon Quay areas in Wellington have lots of large hotels, and several backpackers. Because it is so close to good public transport options, accommodation further away from the CBD is also accessible.

March is a busy time in Wellington's culture calender, which can lead to accommodation shortages. We recommend booking your accommodation early. We'll be announcing some partnerships with nearby hotels for discounts towards the end of 2016.

### Accessibility
