Quadcopters are everywhere, they’re used in research, the military, and even in
commercial applications such as agriculture, delivery, and photography. As they
get cheaper to produce, it’s likely they’ll become ubiquitous in our lifetime.
[NodeBots New Zealand](http://nodebots.co.nz/) is giving you a chance to hack on
drones using JavaScript and Node during __nz.js(con);__

Whether you’re a beginner or expert, now is your chance to learn how drones work
first hand, by coding some JavaScript, and racing a drone in a tournament for
some sweet prizes.

However, if drones aren’t your cup of tea, we have a plethora of other robots,
hardware and projects you can hack on, all using JavaScript, supporting skill
levels from “What even is voltage?” to “I eat solder for breakfast!”.

__Sign up required__: see your ticket email to sign up.

__You will need__: a laptop.

__When/where__: During the conference, in the middle room, from 1:30 -> 3:30 on Friday
