We were all set to announce our\nconference dates for <strong>November the 2nd and 3rd 2020</strong> before the global\nsituation for COVID-19 really became what it is now.</p>\n<p>At this point it’s obviously really hard to say what the situation later this\nyear will really be like, so we're not able to make too many hard and fast\ndecisions. We’re keeping a close eye on things and will post updates as and when\nwe have those available.</p>\n<p>If we need to postpone we will work with our venue to achieve that and let you\nknow! Make sure you sign up to the mailing list for further updates.</p>\n<p>We wish you all well in this difficult time. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-03T05:00:00.000Z","title":"Venue announcement and new date"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"title":"Venue announcement and new date","date":"2020-05-03T05:00:00.000Z","slug":"/news/venue-announcement-and-new-date-2020-05-03"}}}
