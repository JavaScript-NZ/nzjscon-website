Here is the full 2017 conference schedule. All talks have a 5 minute break at
the end to set up for the next speaker and allow you to move between rooms.

There are two limited-availability workshops (up to 50 people). On Thursday
afternoon from 1:45 -> 4:00 there is a [Node CTF event](/workshops/node-ctf/),
and on Friday afternoon from 1:30 -> 3:40 there is a [NodeBots
event](/workshops/nodebots/). Both of these require you to bring your own laptop
and are in the middle room.
