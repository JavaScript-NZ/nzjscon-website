Here is the full 2017 conference schedule. All talks have a 5 minute break at
the end to set up for the next speaker and allow you to move between rooms.

There are two limited-availability workshops (up to 50 people). Both of these
require you to bring your own laptop and are in the middle room, and NodeBots
requires pre-booking.

* Thursday afternoon from 1:45 -> 4:00 is [Node CTF](/workshops/node-ctf/)
* Friday afternoon from 1:30 -> 3:40 is [NodeBots](/workshops/nodebots/)
