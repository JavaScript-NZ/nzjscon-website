In particular (but not exclusively) we are keen to reach out to under-represented groups in tech (women, indigenous, PoC, LGBTIQ folks) with assistance to help broaden the diversity of conference attendees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On a personal note, as a woman in the tech industry, I have more than once heard comments from women colleagues expressing their doubt that they are worthy of being recipients of programs such as this. So just to make it super clear: <strong>If you would like to attend the conference but you don’t think that you can for financial reasons, then the financial aid fund is explicitly for you</strong>. We won’t necessarily be able to help every applicant purely for budgetary reasons, but <strong>please do apply</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>— Jen, conference director</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does it work</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you need to fill out our short form: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/7VAunft3manrYePr7\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Apply for financial aid</a></li>\n<li>We will periodically approve batches of applications. The next set of approvals will be on the 31st of May, and we will contact those approved and work through the details of the assistance they need.
