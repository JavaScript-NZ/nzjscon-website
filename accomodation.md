The waterfront, train station and Lambdon Quay areas in Wellington have lots of large hotels, and several backpackers. Because it is so close to [good public transport options]({{ full_base_url }}/venue-and-directions/), accommodation further away from the CBD is also accessible.

March is a busy time in Wellington's culture calender, which can lead to accommodation shortages. We recommend booking your accommodation early.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are a few suggestions for
nearby options:

* The __Ibis__ is a 3.5 star hotel with rooms starting at $189. [Website](http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-3049-ibis-wellington/index.shtml).
* The __Hotel Waterloo__ is a backpackers that also offers private rooms, starting at $70 per night with a shared bathroom or $89 ensuite. [Website](http://hotelwaterloo.co.nz/).
