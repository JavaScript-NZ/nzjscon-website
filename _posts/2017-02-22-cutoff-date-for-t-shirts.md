Our tickets all come with a complimentary conference t-shirt or (our new option -
check your emails if you'd already selected a t-shirt and want to swap) a
canvas bag - but we need to get our order in to the printers soon. The last date
for you get your details to us and get your t-shirt or bag is __this Sunday, the
26th of Feb, at midnight NZ time__. So if you've been waiting to buy your
ticket, or you have a ticket but you haven't yet entered your details, you need
to get on that sharpish!

#### JavaScript NZ community awards

At the conference we'll be voting on our first JS educator and JS contributer
award recepients - if you'd like to nominate someone for either of these awards
please see the details [on the society website](http://javascript.org.nz/awards).

#### Two weeks to go!

We're now at __less than 25 tickets remaining__, so now is a great time to [get your ticket](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2017) â€”
and don't forget that we have a [Diversity and Financial Aid fund]({{

the conference or getting a ticket.
