In association with our good friends at [NodeBots NZ](http://nodebots.co.nz/)
we're offering a workshop to conference attendees. The NodeBots team can help
you program a quadcopter, plus they have a plethora of other robots, hardware
and projects you can hack on.

On the Friday afternoon between lunch and afternoon tea the middle room will
hold the workshop, which can support up to 50 participants. Because of the
limited space __we need conference attendees to register their spot__ for the
workshop - ticket holders, please check your emails for an annoucement. If you
don't have a ticket for the conference yet, [sign up
now](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2017) and then follow the link in
your ticket confirmation email for the workshop.

#### Less than a month to go

We're now at __less than 60 tickets remaining__, so now is a great time to [get your ticket](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2017) â€”
and don't forget that we have a [Diversity and Financial Aid fund]({{

the conference or getting a ticket.
