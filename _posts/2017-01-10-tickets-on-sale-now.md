You can now [book tickets for  the conference](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2017). Because we only have a medium-sized venue for this — our first — event, we __recommend booking now to avoid disappointment later__ if we sell out quickly.

A standard ticket costs $125, and tickets for unwaged people or students are $60. All conference attendees will be expected to abide by our [code of conduct]({{ full_base_url }}/code-of-conduct/) for the conference.

With only two months left until the conference, keep an eye on our site for more announcements, and tell your friends and colleagues about it!

### Become a speaker - Call For Papers closing soon

The CFP closes on January 22nd - we're counting on you to submit talks, to bring a variety of topics to the conference. Or perhaps you know someone you think would give an excellent talk - please encourage them to submit! We’re using a service to facilitate our CFP, papercall.io, so to find out more and to submit a talk, head over to our [event page there](https://www.papercall.io/nz-js-con) and [make a submission](https://www.papercall.io/cfps/241/submissions/new) (note you'll need to make a user account to do so).

#### Free tickets for speakers

Speakers will get a free ticket as a token of our thanks for your contribution to the conference. However as the CFP is still open and speakers are not yet finalised, you may wish to go ahead with purchasing a ticket now and we can refund you upon your selection as a speaker.
