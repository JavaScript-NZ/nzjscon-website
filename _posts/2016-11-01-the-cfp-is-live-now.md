Our call for papers is up, and you should submit a talk! We're looking for a variety of different kinds of talks, at different levels of complexity and with speakers from a range of different backgrounds. Both new and experienced speakers are welcome! We know that there are lots of JavaScript coders in New Zealand working, studying and hacking on an amazing range of projects, and this is your opportunity to share your experience with the rest of the JS community.

We're using a service to facilitate our CFP, papercall.io, so to find out more and to submit a talk, head over to our [event page there](https://www.papercall.io/nz-js-con) and [make a submission](https://www.papercall.io/cfps/241/submissions/new) (note that you'll need to create a login there to submit).

The CFP will be open until mid-January, but if you have the time now we'd encourage you to get your proposal in soon â€“ it helps maintain the sanity of your faithful conference organisers ;)
