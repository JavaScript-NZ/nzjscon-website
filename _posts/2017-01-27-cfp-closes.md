The call for papers has now closed â€” thank you to all our submitters, we're very
grateful for your hard work. Our team of reviewers will be starting to go
through all the submissions this weekend, and we'll be in touch with potential
speakers soon. We should be able to announce the full schedule for the
conference soon!

As always, don't forget that you can [now buy
tickets](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2017) and that we have a
[Diversity and Financial Aid fund]({{ full_base_url
}}/conference/update/tickets/2017/01/17/diversity-and-financial-aid.html) if you
need help getting to the conference.
