Rather than an afterparty, we have a room booked at [Mac's Brew
Bar](http://macsbrewbar.co.nz/) (a very short walk from the venue) for
__Thursday__ evening. That's to make it easy for out-of-towners to attend, and
also so you can catch up with new folks you meet the day after at the
conference. Matt McKegg aka [DESTROY WITH
SCIENCE](https://soundcloud.com/destroy-with-science) will be providing the JS
powered music.

It's a 'buy-your-own-drinks' event, but we'll provide a few platters of nibbles
(with thanks to NEC for sponsoring some food).

#### Getting to the conference

Don't forget you can find public transport directions to the venue [over on the
venue page](/venue-and-directions/) but also
we've set up [a ridesharing editable
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZaFYoPoAxdjZKVNO-EyINGQNj98kJNxptehJxKZquBU/edit?usp=sharing)
for those of you who are looking to organise between yourselves for a ride to or
from the conference.
