As a community run conference, we rely on volunteers to help make the event a success. We've already had several lovely people volunteer â€” but __we're looking for a few more__, as many hands make light work!

In particular we could use a few more people at the registration desk throughout the conference, and possibly a few more session chairs (who introduce the speakers and keep the conference running on time).

If you're keen to pitch in, here's what you need to know:

* You __must__ be already attending the conference (this is a capacity limitation as we're sold out).
* Email [nzjscon@gmail.com](mailto:nzjscon@gmail.com?subject=Volunteering) with the subject line _'Volunteering'_ so we can give you more info.

#### A week to go

We're at max capacity so sorry there are _no tickets left_. If you missed out
you can at least rest safe in the knowledge that we're recording all conference
talks.

Ticket holders should look out for a few more annoucements (we'll pop you an
email) before kick off time next week.
