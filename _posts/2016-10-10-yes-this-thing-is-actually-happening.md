And I'm pleased to report we're in good shape. We've got a name, a date, a venue, and last but not least this very website that you are reading right now.

We've got an action-packed next few months of preparation to come, still, and this site (or [javascript_nz](https://twitter.com/javascript_nz) on twitter) is your best way of finding out the latest news. Over the next while you should expect to see updates announcing the CFP, our sponsors, our keynote speakers, our request for volunteers, and our tickets being on sale.

__nz.js(con);__ is run by volunteers from JavaScript New Zealand Incorporated. If you'd like to be involved in helping to organise the conference, you can join the [#js-conf](https://javascriptnewzealand.slack.com/messages/js-conf/) channel on the society's [public slack channel](http://slack.javascript.org.nz/).

Want to get in touch with us? Drop us an email at [conference@javascript.org.nz](conference@javascript.org.nz).
