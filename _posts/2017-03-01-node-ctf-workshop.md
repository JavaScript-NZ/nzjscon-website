We're please to annouce that we've got another workshop available for conference
attendees:

Inspired by the KiwiCon badge challenge, __nz.js(con);__ will feature its own
CTF (capture-the-flag) challenge. Trapped in a submarine at the bottom of the
ocean, you must use your JavaScript wits to survive. Whether in teams or alone,
you will complete a series of puzzles as you try to get your ship operational.
Open to all skill levels.

On the Thursday afternoon between lunch and afternoon tea, the middle room will
hold the workshop, which can support up to 50 participants. You don't need to
sign up for this one, but you'll need to bring your laptop along to participate.

Find out [more about the Node CTF event here](/workshops/node-ctf/).

#### Just over a week to go

We're sold out! We're at max capacity so sorry there are _no tickets left_. If you
missed out you can at least rest safe in the knowledge that we're recording all
conference talks.

Ticket holders should look out for a few more annoucements (we'll pop you an
email) before we get this thing rolling next week.
