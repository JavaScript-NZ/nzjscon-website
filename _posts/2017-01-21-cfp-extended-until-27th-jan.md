In honour of the fact that it's long weekend here in Wellington we're extending the call for papers (talk submissions) ever-so-slightly to this Friday, the 27th of January, at 9pm. So there has never been a better time to get your proposal in!

Don't forget that we have a Diversity and Financial Aid fund, which can give you a helping hand if you want to speak but you're not sure if you can afford to attend. You can read more about it [over here]({{ full_base_url }}/conference/update/tickets/2017/01/17/diversity-and-financial-aid.html).

In other news, we're pretty busy here at __nz.js(con); hq__ - ticket sales are rolling in, we're sorting the designs for our t-shirts and stickers, and our keynote speakers will be announced soon! [Buy your ticket now](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2017).
