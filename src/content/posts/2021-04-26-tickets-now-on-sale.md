You can now [book tickets for  the conference](https://ti.to/javascript-nz/nz-js-con-2021). Because we only have a medium-sized venue, we __recommend booking now to avoid disappointment later__ if we sell out quickly.

A standard ticket costs $125, and tickets for unwaged people or students are $60. All conference attendees will be expected to abide by our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/) for the conference.

With less than two months left until the conference, keep an eye on our site for more announcements, and tell your friends and colleagues about it!

### The conference and potential NZ lockdowns

In the event that NZ goes to [level 2](https://covid19.govt.nz/alert-system/alert-level-2/#gatherings-and-events) over the dates of the conference, we will obviously be unable to run the event. In that instance, we will look to delay the event. For this reason, we __highly recommend if you are booking flights or accommodation to attend the conference, that you book flexible/reschedulable flights and accommodation__.

### Volunteer to help run the conference

As a community conference, volunteers are an essential part of making everything run smoothly. We'll need volunteers to help run the registration desk, introduce speakers, take audience questions, and assist with video recording. Don't worry, we'll schedule you so you can still see plenty of the conference too. Let us know during your ticket purchase that you're interested in helping out, and we'll be in touch closer to the event.
