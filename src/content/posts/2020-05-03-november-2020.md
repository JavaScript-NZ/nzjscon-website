Hey all, a little update with where we’re at. We were all set to announce our
conference dates for **November the 2nd and 3rd 2020** before the global
situation for COVID-19 really became what it is now.

At this point it’s obviously really hard to say what the situation later this
year will really be like, so we're not able to make too many hard and fast
decisions. We’re keeping a close eye on things and will post updates as and when
we have those available.

If we need to postpone we will work with our venue to achieve that and let you
know! Make sure you sign up to the mailing list for further updates.

We wish you all well in this difficult time.
