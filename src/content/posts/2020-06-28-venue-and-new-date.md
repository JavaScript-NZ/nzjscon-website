We've taken the difficult decision to move the conference back until next year
to give us a more stable goal, planning-wise.

The conference will now be on the **21st and 22nd of June 2021** at **Shed 6 in
Wellington**.

We'll be looking to open our call for papers in a couple of months, and tickets
will go on sale later this year.

We're still looking for sponsors for the event, if you think you can help
please reach out! And many thanks to our current sponsors for their continued
support.
