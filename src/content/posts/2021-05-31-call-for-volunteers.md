As a community run conference, we rely on volunteers to help make the event a success. We’ve already had several lovely people volunteer — but **we’re looking for a few more**, as many hands make light work!

We are looking for people who can help staff the registration desk throughout the conference (we'll make sure we have a good rotation of people so you still have plenty of time to view talks), some session chairs (who introduce the speakers and keep the conference running on time), and some AV volunteers to help with recording video and audio.

If you’re keen to pitch in, here’s what you need to know:

- You must be already attending the conference (this is a capacity limitation), but you can apply to [our diversity and financial aid fund](/diversity-and-financial-aid-fund) if you're not sure you can afford a ticket
- Let us know you're interested by filling in [this form](https://forms.gle/rTEGrybqQuH8NyXX8). Thank you!
