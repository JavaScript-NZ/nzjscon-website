Our CFP is now live! **nz.js(con);** is a community conference, which means that
all our talks are from members of our community. That means we want **you** to
submit a talk!

The CFP is open until April the 11th, so start thinking about what you might 
like to speak about. We welcome both new and experienced speakers on a really
broad range of topics â€” check out [our CFP on Papercall for more details and to 
submit your talk](https://www.papercall.io/nz-js-con-2021).
