After a hiatus, **nz.js(con);** is back for 2020. We’re aiming for late next
year, and we should be announcing our Wellington venue and our dates soon. If
you’d like to keep up to date with the latest details, head over to the
[conference website](https://conference.javascript.org.nz) to sign up to our
mailing list.

helping put the conference (which is volunteer-run) together — if so head over
to [JavaScript NZ’s slack channel](https://javascript.org.nz/slack) and join the
[#nzjscon](https://javascriptnewzealand.slack.com/messages/nzjscon/) channel.

While you’re waiting patiently for details for the next conference, perhaps you
