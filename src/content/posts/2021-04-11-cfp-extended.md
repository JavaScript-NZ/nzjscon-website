Our call for speakers is **extended** for an additional two weeks to give those of
you who have been thinking about submitting but haven't gotten around to it yet
an extra chance. And many thanks to those of you who have already submitted, there's
some really great submissions in there.

The CFP now closes on the **25th of April** - [submit your talk now](https://www.papercall.io/nz-js-con-2021).
