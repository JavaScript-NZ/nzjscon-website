We are pleased to announce the launch of our Diversity and Financial Aid fund, which has been made possible with the help of all of our wonderful sponsors. It’s open to anyone who would like to attend the conference but wouldn’t normally be able to. In particular we are keen to reach out to under-represented groups in tech (women, PoC, LGBTIQ folks) with assistance to help broaden the diversity of conference attendees.
