Our venue is Shed 6, which is on the waterfront in Wellington. We'll be
splitting the venue up into rooms for the two tracks, and we'll have capacity
for 320 attendees.

It's next door to the TSB Bank Arena, and only a ten minute walk from Wellington
Railway Station (which is also the main bus hub). If you're coming from the
airport there is a bus line that takes about half an hour, or a twenty minute
taxi journey (depending on traffic). Please note that there is no free parking
at the venue.
